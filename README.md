# Hi, I'm Diana! 👋

## Automation Specialist | Process Optimizer | Low-code Developer

### 🚀 About Me

I build systems that eliminate repetitive work. Specializing in automation workflows and internal tools using low-code/no-code platforms (N8n, Zapier) combined with modern web technologies (React, Astro, Vite). 

My unique background in psychology and neuropsychology research gives me an edge in designing user-centric automation that teams actually adopt. I understand not just *how* to automate, but *why* people interact with systems the way they do.

**What I do:**
- 🔄 Design end-to-end automation workflows connecting CRMs, sales tools, and marketing platforms
- 🛠️ Build custom internal web applications for operational efficiency
- 📊 Create data pipelines and automated reporting systems
- 🎯 Optimize lead generation and outreach processes
- 🧠 Apply behavioral insights to improve system adoption and user experience

**Current focus:** Scaling automation infrastructure for tech startups and e-commerce companies.

### 💡 What Makes Me Different

Most automation specialists come from purely technical backgrounds. I combine:

This means I don't just automate processes—I design solutions people actually want to use.
